                        Hi! My name is Kayce. I am enrolled in UW's Coding Bootcamp! I am here to 
                        learn all things HTML and make some cool sites. I am hoping to further myself
                        in my career and help friends and family with websites they have been
                        pushing me for, for quite some time. Previously I have taken UW's Python
                        Progamming class and loved it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I work for Nintendo as a System Admin in the Network Operations Center.
                    I have worked here for almost five years and have worked in a few departments to
                    see where my passion is (IT). My work at Nintendo includes a span of administration
                     in production, network, hardware and software applications as well as within Data 
                     Center management. This consists of ensuring optimum access, performance, capacity
                    and availability of our deployed technologies (internal and external) through 
                    monitoring, incident management, and hardware management.

                    I am involved with Windows Server Administration, Linux Server Administration, 
                    iSeries Server Administration, Cisco Network tools and devices, as well as other
                     Enterprise tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work I can be found spoiling my dog, horse-back riding 
                    on Taylor Mountain, or binge watching my fav TV series (GoT, Westworld,
                    Breaking Bad, etc)
