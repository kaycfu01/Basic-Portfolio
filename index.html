                        Currently I work in the Network Operations Center at Nintendo. 
                        I have been a System Admin here for almost five years. 
                        I am taking the Coding Bootcamp at UW to further my career 
                        and to showcase work I am proud of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work at Nintendo includes a span of administration in production, network, 
                    hardware and software applications as well as within Data Center management. 
                    This consists of ensuring optimum access, performance, capacity and availability 
                    of our deployed technologies (internal and external) through monitoring, incident 
                    management, and hardware management.

                    I am involved with Windows Server Administration, Linux Server Administration, 
                    iSeries Server Administration, Cisco Network tools and devices, as well as other
                     Enterprise tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work I can be found spoiling my dog, horse-back riding 
                    on Taylor Mountain, or binge watching my fav TV series (GoT, Westworld,
                    Breaking Bad, etc)
